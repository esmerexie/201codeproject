    <h1>Welcome to my about me!</h1>

    <p>Hello my name is Rexie Esmeralda. This is a website/project that I have created and it's soul purpose is for you to have a little trivia about me! <br/>
       A little about me, I am currently 26 years old and live in Washington state. I was born and raised in Guam,but decided to join the Navy and that whole <br/>
       journey took me here! I love mangos and working out with weights. My favorite music genre is well just about everything! As long as it sounds good, then its alright with
       me. My goal is to become a software developer and hopefully one day create something that'll help someone even if  it is one person. <br/>
       <br/>
       Well that is it about me, do you think you can pass the trivia?
    </p>
