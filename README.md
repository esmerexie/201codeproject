This project took a very long time for me to finish. I hate to admit it but it was roughly around 5 hours. I was stuck on the functions and just couldn't figure out why my **else if** statements weren't working. Trying to also break the return was a bit of a struggle for me but once I got the ball rolling I was able to complete the task and with all the given instructions that came with it. Was definetly a challenge but I completed it!
